# Changelog

All notable changes to this project have to be documented in this file. At least, that is written on Unity documentation about creating custom packages as a recommendation.

That's fine, but we prefer automating such things, and we keep changelog using [Release Drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) GitHub Action. It follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) approach as well, and it adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

To see the full changelog, please, check the [Releases](https://github.com/linqgg/unity-sdk/releases) section of this repository.
